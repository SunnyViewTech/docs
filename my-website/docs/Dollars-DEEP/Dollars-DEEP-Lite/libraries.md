# Installation and Switching Runtime Librariess

## Download

First, download the required DLL files from [here](https://kilimanjaro.dollarsmocap.com/DEEP_Lite/Dollars_DEEP_Lite_DLLs.zip).

After downloading, unzip the files and place them in the DEEP Lite directory.

Once the files are in place, the DEEP Lite directory should look similar to the image below.

## Switching Runtime Libraries

You need to switch the runtime libraries depending on whether you are using Azure Kinect or Femto Bolt. The method is the same as for DEEP. Please refer to [this page](/Dollars-DEEP/lilbraries) for detailed instructions.
