# Calibration

When you launch Dollars DEEP, the motion capture avatar may appear anywhere on the screen depending on the position of your camera.

Before starting motion capture, stand at the center of your mocap area for calibration.

After calibration, the motion capture avatar will be positioned in the center of the screen.

While calibration, please relax your body, let both hands hang naturally, and look straight ahead.

If you are standing, please ensure that both of your feet can be clearly captured by the camera.
