# Calibration

When you launch Dollars DEEP, depending on the position of your camera, the motion capture avatar might appear anywhere on the screen.

Before motion capture, you can stand at the center of your mocap area for calibration.

After calibration, the motion capture avatar will appear in the center of the screen.

:::info
While calibration, please relax your body, let both hands hang naturally, and look straight ahead.

If you are standing, please ensure that both of your feet can be clearly captured by the camera.

Before each motion capture session, or when changing the motion capture actor midway, you need to perform calibration.
