# Camera Placement and Settings

## Orientation

Dollars DEEP currently only supports horizontal mount of the camera, and it's best to avoid any tilt.

## Height and distance

There are no specific requirements for the height and distance of camera placement.

:::danger Important
The goal is to position the camera so that **it captures the actor as large as possible while fully covering the activity area**.
