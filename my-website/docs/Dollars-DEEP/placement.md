# Camera Placement and Settings

## Orientation

Dollars DEEP currently only supports horizontal mount of the Azure Kinect, and it's best to avoid any tilt.

## Height and distance

There are no specific requirements for the height and distance of Azure Kinect placement.

:::dangerImportant
The goal when placing the camera is to **capture the actor as large as possible, while fully covering the activity area**.
:::

## Select Azure Kinect as Input

You need to select Azure Kinect in the Video Options of Dollars DEEP.

to azure blue.

You can determine whether Azure Kinect has been selected by checking if the motion capture avatar has turned blue.
