# Read Me First

The important points applicable to Dollars MONO also apply to Dollars DEEP, so we reiterate them here.

## The frame should be sufficiently large

Whether your input source is a camera or a video, **always ensure that the frame coverage of the acor is larger than the frame coverage of the virtual character**.

If you want the virtual character to appear from the shoulders up, it's best to film the actor down to the elbows.

If you want the virtual character to appear from the elbows up, it's best to film the actor down to the hands.

If you wish for the virtual character's hands to be fully visible, it's best to film the actor down to below the waist, so that when the hands hang down, they are still within the camera's frame.

If you wish for the virtual character to be fully visible, then the actor also needs to be fully in the frame.

The only exception is, if you wish for the virtual character to be fully visible in the frame, but you are using the upperbody mode, then the actor can be filmed down to below the waist, without needing to be fully in the frame.

## Calibration before motion capture

Calibrating before motion capture can ensure better results in capturing movements and expressions.

:::info
During calibration, please relax your body and facial expressions, let your hands hang naturally by your sides, and look straight ahead.
