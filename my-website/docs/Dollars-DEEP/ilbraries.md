# Switching Runtime Libraries

Dollars DEEP will launch the runtime libraries for Azure Kinect by default. If you are using Femto Bolt, run the Install Femto Bolt Libraries.bat file in the image below before the program starts to switch to a runtime library that supports Femto Bolt.

when you need to use Azure Kinect, you can run the Install Azure Kinect Libraries.bat file to switch to the runtime library that supports Azure Kinect.

:::info
This operation is only necessary the first time you use either Femto Bolt or Azure Kinect.
