## Purchase Recommendations: Full-Body Tracking Configurations

You can select and customize hardware based on the configuration that suits your needs. Here, we provide recommendations for full-body tracking configurations.

### Limited Budget and Willing to Take on Technical Challenges: Configuration 2

This configuration is ideal for users on a limited budget who are willing to handle some technical challenges. It allows you to achieve cost-effective full-body tracking, but you will need to configure the room setup yourself.

**Required Equipment:**

1. **6 VIVE Trackers**

2. **At least 2 VIVE SteamVR Base Stations**

**Total Cost:** Approximately $1,200 USD

Since this configuration does not include a headset or controller, you cannot use the SteamVR room setup directly. Instead, you will need to complete the room setup using the VIVE Trackers.

### Slightly Higher Budget and Prefer Convenience: Configuration 7

If you can slightly increase your budget, this configuration will make full-body tracking easier with minimal setup required.

**Required Equipment:**

1. **HTC VIVE Pro 2 Set** (includes one headset, two controllers, and two VIVE SteamVR Base Stations)

![](../img/O1CN01XsF1WD1aTe5eNoGWU.jpg)

2. **3 VIVE Trackers**

**Total Cost:** Approximately $1,600 USD

This setup not only enables full-body tracking but also allows you to enjoy the latest VR applications, making it ideal for users who value efficiency.

### Sufficient Budget and Higher Capture Quality: Upgraded Configuration

For enhanced tracking quality, you can upgrade the previous configuration by purchasing two Valve Index Controllers to replace the controllers included with the HTC VIVE Pro 2.

**Required Equipment:**

1. **2 Valve Index Controllers**

**Total Cost:** Approximately $2,000 USD

This setup provides full-body motion capture, including finger tracking!

### Configuration Summary

You can choose the most suitable configuration based on your budget and requirements.

After becoming familiar with the VIVE equipment, you can further adjust based on your needs. For example, in Configuration 7, you could add a VIVE Tracker to replace the headset, allowing for a more flexible capture process without being tethered to the headset.
