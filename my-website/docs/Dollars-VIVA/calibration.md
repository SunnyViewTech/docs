# Get Started

Before starting motion capture, calibration is necessary.

Once you have put on the trackers and launched Dollars VIVA, you should see an interface similar to the image below, which displays a mannequin used for motion capture and the positions of the various trackers.

Press the C key or click the calibration button in the top left corner to enter the pre-calibration state.

At this point, please confirm that the VIVE controllers or trackers are being tracked correctly.

Once tracking is confirmed, you can assume the correct posture for calibration and proceed with the process.

he calibration posture for Dollars VIVA is as follows:

Regardless of whether you are using the controllers or trackers, your palms should always be facing forward.
