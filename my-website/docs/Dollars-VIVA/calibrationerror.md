# Common Calibration Issues

Here are some common calibration issues and their solutions.

If the mannequin's legs are crossed when your feet are together, it's because your legs were not together during calibration.

Please put your legs together and calibrate again.

If you find that the mannequin's arms are bent when your arms are extended forward, it is because your arms were not fully extended or open during calibration.

Please straighten your elbows, open your arms and calibrate again. If necessary, you can extend your arms slightly back.

If you find that the mannequin's head is too high or too low while you are in a relaxed state, it is because you had your head raised or lowered during calibration.

Please make sure to keep your eyes straight ahead and complete the calibration.
