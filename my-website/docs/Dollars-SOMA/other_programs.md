# Using with Other Dollars MoCap Products

## Shared Camera

If you wish to use SOMA simultaneously with other Dollars MoCap products, you can use OBS virtual camera to enable one camera input for multiple programs.

For information about virtual cameras, please [refer here](/Dollars-MONO/sharecam).

## Engine Side

No additional operations are required on the engine side.

Simply ensure that SOMA's streaming port and address settings match those of other programs, allowing the engine to simultaneously receive SOMA's gesture events and motion capture data from other Dollars MoCap products.
