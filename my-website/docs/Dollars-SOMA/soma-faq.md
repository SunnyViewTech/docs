## How to add custom gesturesï¼Ÿ

Dollars SOMA currently does not support custom gestures. If you would like to add specific gestures, please contact us through the contact details on our website.

## Does it support multiple users being tracked simultaneously?

**Body gestures:** Only supports tracking and recognition for a single user.

**Hand gestures:** Multiple users can be monitored simultaneously, but the program will prioritize the clearest and largest gesture in the frame for processing.
