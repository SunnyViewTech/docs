## Dominant Eye
Due to factors like lighting, camera angles, image clarity, or wearing glasses during the capture, there may be instances where the eye gaze of both eyes is misaligned. In such cases, you can ensure synchronized eye gaze by setting a dominant eye.

Please note that setting a dominant eye will prevent you from making crossed-eye expressions.
