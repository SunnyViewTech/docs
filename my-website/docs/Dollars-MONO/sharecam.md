# Sharing the Camera across Multiple Applications

Below we will show you how to use OBS virtual camera to share the same camera in multiple applications, so that you can do motion capture in Dollars MONO, while also do facial capture in VTuber softwares such as Animaze and VSeeFace.

You can download OBS here, https://obsproject.com

You can add a desktop window, or video capture device to OBS and start the virtual camera using the button on the right.
