# Calibration

When positioning the camera, you may sometimes tilt it slightly to obtain a more comprehensive view of the person being captured.

However, this tilt can cause the person to appear as if they are leaning forward from the camera's perspective, leading to inaccurate motion capture results.

To correct this, you can use the calibration feature by pressing the button within the red box.

Calibration Steps:

1. Sit upright during calibration.
2. When the countdown ends and the "Calibration Completed" message is displayed, you can begin capturing motion.
