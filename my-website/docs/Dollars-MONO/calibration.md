# Calibration

When we place the camera, sometimes we tilt the camera to a certain degree in order to get a more comprehensive view of the person being captured.

In this case, from the camera's point of view, the person will lean forward, resulting in inaccurate motion capture results.

You can press the button in the red box to calibrate.

Please sit upright during calibration, when the countdown ends and the "Calibration Completed" message is displayed, you can start capturing motion.
