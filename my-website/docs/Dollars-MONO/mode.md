## Upper Body Mode

In the Upper Body mode, motion capture will only capture your upper body, while the lower body will be locked.

## Jump Mode

In the Jump mode, changes in your waist position will be interpreted as changes in height, allowing for actions such as jumping and crouching.

However, in this mode, you will not be able to move forward or backward.

For example, Jump mode is suitable for the following action,

## Ground Mode

In Ground mode, changes in your waist position will be interpreted as changes in position on the ground, allowing for actions such as moving forward or backward.

However, in this mode, you will not be able to jump.

For example, Ground mode is suitable for the following action,

The same video in Jump Mode,

Jump mode is intended to capture jumping, crouching, and similar actions, while the Ground mode is intended to capture walking, running, or similar actions.

Using the wrong mode will result in less accurate motion capture and may not capture the desired actions. So, it is important to understand the difference between the two modes and to use the correct one for the desired action.
