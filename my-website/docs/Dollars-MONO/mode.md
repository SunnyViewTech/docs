## Upper Body Mode

In the Upper Body mode, motion capture will only capture your upper body, while the lower body will be locked.

## Jump Mode

In the Jump mode, changes in your waist position will be interpreted as changes in height, allowing for actions such as jumping and crouching.

However, in this mode, you will not be able to move forward or backward.

For example, Jump mode is suitable for the following action,

## Ground Mode

In Ground Mode, changes in your waist position are interpreted as movements on the ground, enabling actions such as moving forward or backward. 

However, you won¡¯t be able to capture jumping actions in this mode.

For example, Ground Mode is suitable for capturing actions like walking or running.
