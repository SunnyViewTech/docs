# Using Virtual Camera as Input

Starting from v.230722, Dollars MONO supports OBS virtual camera. With the help of the virtual camera, the following scenarios can be achieved,

- Mount the web camera vertically for easier full-body shots.
- Use a smartphone as the video source to achieve both facial and motion capture with just one device.
- Directly capture motion from the desktop window.

You can download OBS here, https://obsproject.com/

You can click the button on the right side in OBS to start the virtual camera.

You can use the Window Capture feature of OBS to directly capture other windows on the screen, and use it as motion capture input.

Or screen mirroring a mobile phone to the computer, and do both the facial and motion capture by using apps like Live Link Face.
