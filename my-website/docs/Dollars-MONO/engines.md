# Stream To Unity & Unreal

You can enable or disable the streaming function in the options dialog.

The Target IP option is the IP address of the computer where the engine is located. If you use motion capture and the engine on the same computer, keep it as 127.0.0.1.

The port option is the port that the Dollar MoCap engine plugin is listening on. By using these ports, you can achieve multi-person motion capture in one project.
