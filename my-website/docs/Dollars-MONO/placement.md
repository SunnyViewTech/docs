# Camera Setup

1. **Define capture origin and range**

Mark the actor’s standing origin in the capture space and define their activity area.

2. **Determine camera distance**

Adjust the distance between the camera and the actor to ensure the actor’s full body is always within the frame while moving inside the defined range. Make sure that when the actor raises their arms, they also remain within the frame.

Based on maintaining full-body coverage, move the camera closer when possible to improve capture accuracy and detail.

3. **Determine camera height**

Adjust the camera height so that when the actor stands at the origin, the virtual avatar’s feet naturally align with the ground.

4. **Other considerations**

- Avoid overly complex or distracting backgrounds.
- Avoid backlighting, ensure even and stable lighting.
- Pay attention to power cables and connection cable lengths.
