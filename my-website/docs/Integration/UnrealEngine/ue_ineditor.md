# Using Dollars MoCap Plugin in UE Editor

:::info

You need the Dollars MoCap Plugin supporting Unreal Engine 5.3 or above to use this Play-in-Editor feature.

In addition, this feature currently supports only one mocap character at a time. Controlling multiple characters simultaneously within the editor is not yet available.

:::



## Preparation

1. Complete the integration steps as shown in our [tutorial videos](/ue-characters).

2. In the character blueprint, add a custom event that enables ```Set Update Animation in Editor``` for **all Skeletal Meshes**. Also enable ```Call In Editor``` for this event.

3. In the scene, in addition to placing the character blueprint and DollarsReceiver, also add **Dollars > Blueprints > EUB_DollarsTick**.

## MoCap in Editor (UE4 Mannequin as an example)

1. In the scene, select ```Dollar Receiver``` and click ```Listen``` in the details panel.

If the ```OSCServer``` variable is not None before clicking ```Listen```, you can click ```Stop``` to clear it.

2. After clicking ```Listen```, you will see that the ```OSCServer``` variable is assigned.

4. Enable UE Streaming in the Dollars application, and you will be able to control the character directly in the editor in real time, without entering Play mode.
