# Calibration

## Purpose of Calibration

If the iOS device is tilted forward or backward during placement, it may cause the captured character to lean accordingly. Calibration helps correct this issue.

Additionally, individual facial features may introduce baseline deviations that affect expression accuracy. Calibration allows for more accurate detection of dynamic facial expressions.

## How to Calibrate

Click the button at the bottom of the program to start calibration.

During calibration, relax your body and facial expression, let your arms hang naturally, and look straight ahead.

Once the countdown ends and the "Calibration Complete" message appears, you can begin normal motion capture.

You can cancel calibration at any time by clicking the same button again.
