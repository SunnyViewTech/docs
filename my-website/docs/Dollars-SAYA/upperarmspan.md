# Measure Upper Arm Span

## Purpose of Measurement

Since the body proportions of your final display model may differ from those of our motion capture reference model, actions like bringing the hands close together or performing a prayer pose may result in the model's hands being too far apart or overlapping. Setting a suitable upper arm span helps to improve these issues.

:::warning

In real-time motion capture, actions involving physical contact between body parts, such as clasped hands, remain technically challenging and may not always be perfectly reproduced.

## How to Measure

Please complete synchronization between SAYA and your model before measuring, as the measurement relies on observing your model’s pose.

Click the button at the bottom of the program to start the measurement.

During measurement, bring your fingertips close together in front of your chest. Avoid placing your hands too close, as this may confuse the tracking and affect accuracy.

Once measurement begins, the program will automatically adjust the upper arm span in a loop. Observe your model, and when the wrists just touch, nod your head to confirm.

Alternatively, you can note the span value shown on screen when the wrists touch, and manually enter it in the settings.

You can cancel the measurement at any time by clicking the same button again.

After measurement, you can fine-tune the upper arm span as needed for better results.
