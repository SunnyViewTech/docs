# Connecting to iClone

## Using the iClone Plugin

After confirming that Dollars LINK can receive facial capture data from Live Link Face, you can proceed to use the Dollars MoCap plugin in iClone.

You can learn how to use the plugin [here](/iClone).

Once set up, you can perform facial capture in iClone via Live Link Face.

## Modifying the Port

If you need to modify the port that listens to Live Link Face, you can change the corresponding port value in the Options window.
